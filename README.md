# Incident Response and GRC Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for an academic Incident Response and Compliance capstone project. The project involved designing a cybersecurity governance and incident readiness package for a mock small business, **Miss Jean’s Flowers**, a multi location retail organization with centralized IT operations.

The focus of this project was not live incident handling or tool execution, but the **design of structured, repeatable security documentation** aligned to recognized cybersecurity governance and response frameworks.

## Mock Organization Profile
Miss Jean’s Flowers is a fictional retail and distribution company with the following characteristics:

- Three locations: two retail stores and one headquarters with centralized flower distribution
- Centralized Point of Sale system hosted at headquarters and accessed remotely via VPN
- Office 365 email environment
- Windows domain joined employee workstations
- Limited IT staffing and basic backup practices

This profile was intentionally selected to reflect common constraints faced by small to medium sized businesses.

---

## Problem Statement
The organization faced two primary cybersecurity risks:

1. **Ransomware**, with high potential impact to availability of POS systems and business operations
2. **Phishing**, serving as a likely initial access vector through employee email accounts

The objective was to design governance and incident readiness artifacts that could realistically improve security posture and preparedness within these constraints.

---

## Framework Alignment
The project deliverables were aligned to the following frameworks:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** for control categorization, gap identification, and maturity thinking
- **COBIT** governance principles to ensure accountability, oversight, and business alignment

Frameworks were used as guidance for structure and intent, not as a compliance checklist.

---

## Deliverables
This repository includes the following documentation:

- **Cybersecurity Self-Assessment**
  - Framework aligned assessment mapping organizational controls to NIST CSF functions and COBIT principles
  - Designed to identify gaps, maturity level, and priority improvement areas

- **Ransomware Tabletop Exercise Package**
  - Scenario based tabletop exercise focused on ransomware impact to POS and headquarters systems
  - Includes objectives, injects, discussion prompts, and decision points for stakeholders

- **Incident Response Playbook**
  - Tailored IR playbook appropriate for a small organization
  - Defines roles, escalation criteria, response phases, and recovery guidance
  - Emphasizes clarity, repeatability, and business impact awareness

---

## Scope and Limitations
- This project was conducted as an **academic capstone** using a **mock organization**
- No live incidents were handled
- No detection, forensic, or response tools were deployed or operated
- The value of the project lies in governance design, readiness planning, and documentation quality

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cybersecurity governance and framework alignment (NIST CSF, COBIT)
- Incident response planning and readiness design
- Business focused cyber risk analysis and communication
- Security documentation and structured assessment development
